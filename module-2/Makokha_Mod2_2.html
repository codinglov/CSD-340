    <p><span class="sentence">I grew up in a small town in Kenyan known as Kakamega,located in the western province. In Kenya I had a simple childhood. Going to school and walking home with friends are most of the memories I have. I developed a love for the outdoors young. I remember going hiking, playing outside and road trips to the country with my family and friends</span>.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include reading, hiking, and spending time with my family. I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes.My boyfriend and children are always my hungry customers.Eager to try my meals.</p>
    <p>My favorite foods are Ugali, which is a staple food in Kenya made from maize flour, and Nyama Choma, which is grilled meat. I also love pizza and pasta.</p>
